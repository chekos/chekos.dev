# about me
hola again 👋🏼
I’m Sergio Sánchez Zavala, a hip hop head, data nerd, and policy wonk from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. 

I currently work at [TalkingPoints](https://talkingpts.org), a non-profit that helps families and schools communicate better across language barriers. 

I’m also the creator of [tacosdedatos.com](https://tacosdedatos.com), a platform that offers data analysis and visualization resources in Spanish.

My passion is to make research clear and easy to understand, and I’m working on developing accessible, open-source tools. 

I have a background in Economics and International Relations from the University of California, Davis, and I mix public policy insights with technical expertise to make a positive impact through data.

When I’m not working, I like to play with IoT projects and use open-source hardware like Raspberry Pi to bring my ideas to life. 

I believe in simple, thoughtful design and I try to make complex solutions easier to understand. Whether it’s building a new application or fixing a line of code, I’m always looking for ways to improve things.

Thanks for stopping by!
