hola again üëãüèº
I'm Sergio S√°nchez Zavala‚Äîa hip hop head, data nerd, and policy wonk originally from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. 
Currently, I work at [TalkingPoints](https://talkingpts.org), a non-profit dedicated to bridging communication gaps between families and schools across language barriers. 
I'm also the creator of [tacosdedatos.com](https://tacosdedatos.com), a platform aimed at providing data analysis and visualization resources in Spanish.

My passion lies in making research transparent and reproducible, focusing on developing accessible, open-source tools. 
With a background in Economics and International Relations from the University of California, Davis, I blend public policy insights with technical expertise to drive social impact through data.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy experimenting with IoT projects, utilizing open-source hardware like Raspberry Pi to bring innovative ideas to life. 
I believe in the power of thoughtful, minimal design and strive to simplify complex solutions, whether it's crafting a new application or refining a line of code.

Thanks for stopping by!
